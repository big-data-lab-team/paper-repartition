\section{Introduction}
%----------------------------------------
% big data challenges
With the improvement of acquisition methods and the growth in the amount of data
available in several scientific domains such as health
sciences~\cite{bigdata_health}~\cite{Amunts1472}, geology~\cite{big_data_geology}
and astrophysics~\cite{biguniverse}, new big data challenges have emerged related
to the processing of large amounts of data and ultra-high resolution
images. Big Brain, a human brain model providing microscopic data (20 micrometers) for
modeling and simulation~\cite{Amunts1472} is an example of ultra high resolution
images in the neuroscience field.

\subsection{Data storage on disk}
% explain storage order
Previous work focused on optimizing the data storage by looking for an optimal
chunk shape that would reduce the expected number of chunks to be retrieved by
any query~\cite{optimal_chuking} or by optimizing the ordering of the chunks
using space filling curves for example~\cite{optimal_chuking, openconnectomecluster}.
Instead, our approach is to leave the choice of the
data storage to the application as much as possible, as in~\cite{seqalgorithms}.
We therefore assume that
the chunk shape and the data ordering in files are arbitrary but known.

For the sake of clarity and without loss of generality,
 we assume in this study that files are written in row-major order (a.k.a
``C" order), where the fastest moving dimension in the file is the last
dimension in the array, and the slowest moving dimension in the file is the first
dimension in the array. For example a 3D array with dimensions $i$, $j$ and $k$
would be written on disk by writing the complete columns in the k dimension first
(see Figure~\ref{fig:seeks_and_rowmajor} (a)).
Our experiments use the HDF5~\cite{hdf5} file format as it is commonly used in the
scientific community and it is written in \texttt{C-order} by default.

  right subfigure shows how reading or writing only one part of a cuboid written
  in the \texttt{C-order} can produce seeks. Each cross represents a seek.}
  \label{fig:seeks_and_rowmajor}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Multidimensional array chunking}
% use of chunking
Scientific data is often represented as multidimensional arrays stored in
chunks to facilitate processing and storage. Among other advantages, chunking
allows for efficient queries, flexibility in adding new
data~\cite{optimal_chuking}, parallel processing, and out-of-core
computations through block algorithms~\cite{matthew_rocklin-proc-scipy-2015}.

% need for tools to repartition
Using chunked multidimensional arrays requires tools to efficiently split,
merge, and ``resplit" or ``repartition" data files. Previous work in~\cite{seqalgorithms}
showed that naive algorithms to split an array into several chunks or merge
array chunks into one output file do not perform well due to millions of seeks
occurring on disk. This study is focused on sequential algorithms for
repartitioning multidimensional arrays, letting the parallel and distributed
cases as future work, although they are relevant, too. To the best of our
knowledge, the repartition problem has not been extensively studied.

% why subarray extraction incurs seeks
Indeed, retrieving sub-arrays from an array stored on disk incurs seeks in two
situations: (1) when an array block is opened for reading or writing, and (2)
when the reading or writing process moves within the block to access a
contiguous piece of data. For a 3D cuboid of shape $C = (C_i, C_j, C_k)$ stored
in row-major order, each column of data in the k dimension is contiguously
stored. There are therefore $C_j \times C_i$ data columns that all require a
seek (see Figure~\ref{fig:seeks_and_rowmajor} (b)).
Although the seek time depends on various parameters such as the distance
in bytes between two data columns, we assume that all seeks incur the same time
overhead for the sake of simplicity. Therefore our problem will be to minimize
the number of seeks required to access data.

Not only extracting a subarray from a chunk incurs seeks on disk, but also
accessing any piece of data from a chunk results in loading the whole chunk in
memory. Chunking must therefore be used with care as it can be detrimental for
performance. The Python library \texttt{h5py} for manipulating HDF5 files
recommends a chunk size ``between 10 KiB and 1 MiB" and more for larger
datasets~\cite{collette_2014}. The \texttt{dask} Python package presented
hereafter also mentions the issues relative to chunking and suggests a chunk
size greater than 100 MB, although remainding that the chunk shape selection is
highly dependent on the application~\cite{rocklin_bourbeau_2019}.

\subsection{Dask}
\texttt{dask} is a popular Python package, part of the SciPy ecosystem, enabling parallel
and out-of-core computations~\cite{matthew_rocklin-proc-scipy-2015}. It has an
important scientific community which is likely to have the problem we try to
solve in this paper, i.e. repartitioning multidimensional array files. That is why
we decided to implement our work as an optimization package for \texttt{dask}.
We focus on the \texttt{dask.array} collection, a data structure designed for
multi-dimensional array processing using blocked algorithms, hence leveraging
chunking.

\texttt{dask} represents computations as task graphs that are dynamically executed by one
of several schedulers including the single-threaded, the multi-threaded, the
multi-process, and the distributed schedulers. Custom schedulers can also be
implemented. \texttt{dask} graphs can be used out-of-the-box or through
built-in APIs. A \texttt{dask} graph is implemented in plain Python as a
dictionary with any hashable as keys and any object as values. More precisely,
a ``Value" is any object different than a task and a ``Task" is a tuple with a
callable as first element. Examples of APIs/collections include
\texttt{dask.array}, a parallel and out-of-core
Numpy clone, and \texttt{dask.dataframe}, a Pandas clone.

\subsection{Contributions}
This paper makes the following contributions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Definition of the repartition problem for multidimensional arrays
  \item A sequential algorithm to efficiently repartition multidimensional arrays
  \item An open implementation of this algorithm in \texttt{dask},
  in a library called \texttt{dask repartition}.
  \item An open implementation in \texttt{dask} of the ``clustered" split and
  merge strategy described in~\cite{seqalgorithms}, in \texttt{dask repartition} too.
\end{itemize}

\section{Problem definition}
\subsection{The repartition problem}
We focus on 3D arrays for simplicity. Consider a 3D array of shape $R =
(R_i, R_j, R_k)$, partitioned as input blocks of uniform shape $I = (I_i,
I_j, I_k)$ stored on disk. Our goal is to repartition the input blocks into output blocks
of uniform but different shape $O = (O_i, O_j, O_k)$. A repartitioning function reads the input blocks from
disk, and writes the output blocks to disk.

A re-partioning algorithm (Algorithm~\ref{algo:generalrepartition}) takes a
list of input blocks \texttt{inBlocks} of shape $I$, a list of output block definitions
\texttt{outBlocks} of shape $O$ and the amount of memory \texttt{m}
available for the algorithm. Subject to $m$, the algorithm first defines an ordered list of buffers positions
\texttt{buffersList} (line 2) and a \texttt{writing policy} \tristan{The definition of this policy is ambiguous}.
\texttt{buffersList} defines the partition of array $R$ to be used by the algorithm internally.
The buffers are then loaded sequentially from disk
(line 4-5), and their data is stored in a memory cache (line 6). After each buffer load,
the \texttt{writing policy} is used by the algorithm to know when and where to
write down the data from the cache to the output files (lines 7 and 8). An
example of a writing policy could be:
``write the data from the cache into the appropriate output file only when all
the data from that output file has been successfully loaded".

For simplicity, we require that all buffers in \texttt{buffersList} have
the same shape $B$. Our objective function
$\mathrm{seeks}$ returns the number of seeks incurred by the use of
$B$ and $\mathrm{policy}$ in the repartitioning algorithm. The
repartitioning problem is to find $B$ and $\mathrm{policy}$ that minimize
$\mathrm{seeks(B, policy)}$ subject to $m$. Solutions of this problem materialize as
implementations of function \texttt{getBufferPositions} in
Algorithm~\ref{algo:generalrepartition}.

A lower bound on the number of seeks for the repartitioning problem is
$n_i + n_o$, with $n_i$ the number of input files and $n_o$ the number of output
files. Indeed, input and output files all have to be accessed at least once,
which requires a seek.

      \FOR{(fileIndex, data) in getDataToWrite(cache, policy)}
        \STATE write(outFiles[fileIndex], data)
      \ENDFOR
    \ENDFOR

  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{The multiple and clustered strategies}
Special cases of the repartitioning problem occur when $I=R$ (``split'' problem)
or when $O=R$ (``merge'' problem). Two strategies were introduced
in~\cite{seqalgorithms} to address these problems: the ``multiple" and the
``clustered" strategies. In these strategies, every loaded buffer is directly written to the
destination output files. It is equivalent to defining the writing policy
as ``write all the cache into the appropriate output files". The only difference
between the merge and the cluster strategies lies in definition of the buffer shape $B$.

In the split problem studied in~\cite{seqalgorithms} $(I=R)$, a naive
strategy defines buffers with the same shape as the output blocks
($B$=$O$). The buffers are iteratively loaded from $R$ and entirely written
to the appropriate output block. The clustered strategy, however, loads as
many contiguous data blocks of shape $O$ as possible to fit in $m$.
Depending on the amount of main memory available, data blocks may be loaded
individually, by entire columns, or by entire slabs. Using the clustered
strategy for repartitioning would imply reading multiple complete input
blocks, which incurs seeks in the output blocks, or reading complete output
blocks by seeking into input files. In either case one can find special
cases in which the algorithm seeks in all dimensions \tristan{Last sentence is a bit vague}.

The multiple strategy used for the split problem  in~\cite{seqalgorithms}
aims at not doing any seek while reading and writing \tristan{all strategies aim at not seeking, reformulate}.
Both the input file and the output blocks are read/written contiguously. In
terms of Algorithm~\ref{algo:generalrepartition}, this means defining buffers as
contiguous parts of the input array. It is equivalent to extending the buffer
in the inverse of the storage order: $k \rightarrow j \rightarrow i$ in the case
of the \texttt{C-order}. The tradeoff lies in switching between files
at each buffer loading. Using this strategy for the repartition task would imply
reading contiguous columns or slices of data from the input files and writing it
contiguously in the output files. This would result in even more switches
between input and output files and one can find worst cases when using small
$I$ and $O$ shapes for example where a smarter strategy would be appreciated. \tristan{This paragraph is unclear}

To the best of our knowledge, no algorithm has been proposed for the
repartitioning task. The ``keep" algorithm presented below can be seen as an
adaptation of the multiple strategy to the repartitioning problem.

\subsection{Baseline solution}

Our baseline algorithm for the repartitioning problem loads one input block
at a time, that is, $B$=$I$ in
Algorithm~\ref{algo:generalrepartition}, and directly writes it to the appropriate output blocks.
For the basline algorithm, we assume that one input block fits in memory ($m \geq I_iI_jI_k$).
As in Algorithm~\ref{algo:generalrepartition}, each buffer is loaded only once.

The buffer order has no implication on the number of seeks, so let us set the buffer order arbitrarily
to the storage order ($i \rightarrow j \rightarrow k$ in \texttt{C-order}).

The number of seeks $s$ induced by this baseline algorithm is the
sum of the number of seeks done for each buffer, that is, the sum of:
\begin{itemize}
  \item the number of buffers (1 seek per input block)
  \item the number of output blocks (1 seek to open each output block)
  \item the number of seeks done by writing into the output blocks
\end{itemize}
To compute the last term, let us define $p_x$ the partition of $R_x$
such that each element in $p_x$ is included in exactly one input block and in exactly one output block \tristan{is this what you mean?}
(see Figure~\ref{fig:p}). $d_x$ is the number of elements in $p_x$.
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.15]{./figures/new/p.jpeg}
  \caption{desc.}
  \label{fig:p}
  \end{figure}

We say that there is a \emph{shape mismatch} in a given dimension $x$ if $I_x$
isn't a multiple of $O_x$, and $O_x$ isn't a multiple of $I_x$.

Let us consider a given buffer (of shape $I$). In case of a mismatch in
dimension $k$ the buffer is divided into two parts in dimension $k$ which results
in  $2*I_i*I_j$ seeks. Any mismatch in dimension $i$ or $j$ would cut the
buffer at the end of an output data column, and is therefore included in
the number of seeks due to the mismatch in $k$. The same observation can be made
between dimension $j$ and $i$: the seeks occuring from a mismatch in $i$ are
included in the seeks occuring by a mismatch in $j$. Therefore, the number of
seeks at write time is computed in one of three distinct cases:
(1) $I_k \neq O_k$, (2) $I_k = O_k$ and $I_j \neq O_j$ and (3) $I_k = O_k$,
$I_j = O_j$ but $I_i \neq O_i$. Equation~\ref{eq:1} gives the amount of seeks
done by writing data in output files for the whole baseline algorithm.
The case is indicated using $\alpha$, defined as: \\
$$\alpha_x = \begin{cases}
   1 & \mathrm{if} I_x \neq O_x \leftrightarrow d_x > 0 \\
   0 & \mathrm{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

\begin{multline} \label{eq:1}
s_{write} = [(d_k+1)R_iR_j]\alpha_k \\ + [(d_j+1)R_i\frac{R_k}{I_k}](1-\alpha_k)\alpha_j \\ + [(d_i+1)\frac{R_j}{I_j}\frac{R_k}{I_k}](1-\alpha_k)(1-\alpha_j)\alpha_i
\end{multline}

The seeks for opening output files are included in Equation~\ref{eq:1}.
In case of no shape mismatch, no seek occur when writing the data into the output
files apart from opening the output files. However, no shape mismatch imply no
repartition problem so we do not consider this case in $s$.

Finally, an equation for $s$ is: $s = s_{write} + s_{read}$,
with $s_{read} = \frac{R_i}{I_i} \frac{R_j}{I_j} \frac{R_k}{I_k}$, the number of
input files a.k.a. buffers to read.

}
\label{fig:baseline_math_model}
\end{figure}

It seems from Equation~\ref{eq:1} that unless the dimensions of the input and
output files match, a considerable amount of seeks will occur, the number of
seeks being factors of $R_k$, $R_j$ and/or $R_i$. Also, a shape mismatch in the
$k$ dimension should be more costly than a shape mismatch in the $j$ dimension,
which is itself more costly than a mismatch in dimension $i$ (assuming that the
files are stored in C-order). The seek model has been implemented to confirm
these theories by an experiment on cubic shapes
(Figure~\ref{fig:baseline_math_model}). The shapes used for the experiment are
described in Table~\ref{tab:expseekmodel}. \tristan{All the experiments and results should be moved to the section on experiments and results.
If the goal of this experiment is to validate the seek model, then the values predicted by the seek model should also appear on the graph.}

%----------------------------------------
\section{The ``keep" algorithm}
%----------------------------------------

\subsection{The keep strategy}

As mentioned previously, like the split and merge strategies the baseline
algorithm for the repartition problem empties the cache at each iteration. In a
split/merge/repartition problem a lot of seeks occur in case of a shape mismatch,
for example, when a data column loaded in memory is split between two output
files or more. We propose to leverage the cache using a \texttt{keep strategy}
to keep some data in the cache while it cannot be written contiguously in output
files~\ref{fig:keepvsbaseline}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{./figures/new/naive_vs_keep.jpeg}
\caption{desc.}
\label{fig:keepvsbaseline}
\end{figure}

In the cache (Algorithm~\ref{algo:generalrepartition}), the data that is not
contiguous in its output file of destination is called \texttt{extra data}.
The \texttt{keep strategy} first consists in finding a buffer shape covering at least
one output file completely, i.e. $B_x>O_x$ for all dimensions $x$.
Such a buffer shape would allow to always have extra data in case of a shape
mismatch, hence making the cache management possible to reduce the number of seeks.
If $m$ is too small, then the keep strategy tries to find a buffer
shape as closed as possible from the optimal buffer shape. Using such an optimal
buffer shape and being able to keep all the extra data into memory during the
whole repartition algorithm would incur the minimum number of seeks possible: $n_i + n_o$.
Indeed, it is equivalent to writing an output file only when all its data is in
cache.
The implementation of the keep strategy is equivalent to implementing
\texttt{getBufferPositions} in Algorithm~\ref{algo:generalrepartition} to find a
buffer shape closed to the optimal buffer shape, and defining the write policy
as ``write all the data that is not extra data".

\subsection{Input aggregates}
Our goal is to find the optimal buffer shape such that $B_x>O_x$ in any dimension $x$.
If $I_x > O_x$, then $B_x$ can be set to $I_x$. If $I_x < O_x$ however, $B_x$
must be a multiple of $I_x$ in order to keep reading each input file in one seek.
We define an \texttt{input aggregate} as being the minimum aggregate of input files that
covers one output file completely. In particular, it is the input aggregate that
covers the first output file (indexed $(0,0,0)$) in the original image being
repartitioned. The best buffer shape for the keep strategy is therefore the shape of
an input aggregate. We call this shape $\Lambda$.

\subsection{Stretching the buffer in the inverse storage order}
To get a buffer shape close to $\Lambda$ we define an algorithm
\texttt{getBufferShape} in \texttt{getBufferPositions} that stretches the
buffer shape step by step. At each step, the algorithm estimates how much the
buffer can be stretched in one direction while keeping the remainders into
memory. The problem of what dimension to increase first still stands. A
strategic order seems to be to stretch the buffer in the direction which saves
the maximum number of seeks first. Given the analysis of the baseline algorithm,
such an order is the inverse of the storage order i.e.
$k \rightarrow j \rightarrow i$ for the \texttt{C-order}.

\subsection{Impact of the buffer order on performance}
Using the keep strategy, one may order the buffer loadings to reduce the maximum
quantity of extra data stored in memory, hence, reducing the amount of seeks.
For example, if an overlap occurs only in the $k$ axis, loading the next buffers
in this direction will enable recycling the extra data kept in memory, resulting
in a smallest memory consumption over time. The memory saved thanks to a smart
ordering could enable the storage of more overlaps in memory using the
``keep strategy", further reducing the overall number of seeks.

As explained in the discussion, the buffer ordering problem is complex and does
not seem easily solvable.
This study uses a naive order which is the storage order. Note that using such
an order allows recycling extra data in the $k$ dimension first, it is therefore
most efficient when the biggest overlap between input and output files is in the
$k$ dimension.

Thanksfully, the impact of the buffer ordering on performance can be
mitigated. Indeed, the impact of the buffer ordering depends on the size of the
mismatches. One can reduce the amount of extra data by using smallest chunks: Even
if the overlap between the input and output files is big with respect to their
size, the area/volume of the overlap will be kept small.

%----------------------------------------
\section{The buffer extension algorithm}
%----------------------------------------

The buffer extension algorithm aims at extending the buffer shape from
(1,1,$\Lambda_k$) to the input aggregate shape $\Lambda$. Note that we assume
that $m$ is large enough to store a buffer of shape (1,1,$\Lambda_k$). It means
that we can read one complete data column from an input file and keep the
remainder in memory for the next buffer. If it was not the case the keep
algorithm would not give a significant improvement in the number of seeks
produced by the repartition task, compared to the baseline algorithm.

In this analysis, we express the quantity of memory used by an array as the
number of voxels it contains. It is equivalent to saying that the number of
bytes per voxel is 1. With $\alpha$ the number of bytes per voxel in the storage
device, $m$ is defined as $m/\alpha$ in the following computations.

The following subsections cover how we estimate the amount of memory required
by the keep strategy to know how much the buffer can be stretched in a given
direction while keeping the extra data in memory. The amount of memory required
is the maximum memory consumption reached during the execution of the keep algorithm.
To estimate this amount, we first need to define what a remainder volume is.

\subsection{Remainder volumes}

A buffer of shape $\Lambda$ can be divided in
8 parts or ``volumes" (Figure~\ref{fig:nomenclature_overlaps}).
7 out of these 8 volumes are called \texttt{remainder volumes} because
they represent the overlap between the input files and the output files on
the buffer borders. These 7 remainder volumes enclose an 8th part that is composed of
input files that are either complete or which complementary part have already
been loaded by a previous buffer. This means that any complementary part is either
in memory (it has been kept in cache according to the keep strategy) or it has
been written down previously. Therefore, this 8th volume cannot be kept by the
keep strategy and is not considered a remainder. For each buffer, each of volume
is indexed following the buffer order $F_0$ to $F_7$, with $F_0$ being the
non-remainder volume. If the buffer is smallest than the input aggregate or if
there is no shape mismatch in a given dimension, it may be that a volume size
is set to 0.

\begin{figure*}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{./figures/new/nomenclature_overlaps.png}
\caption{Division of a buffer into 8 parts indexed according to the storage
order, 7 of which are remainder volumes.}
\label{fig:nomenclature_overlaps}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Maximum memory consumption}

Having partitioned the buffers into volumes, the maximum memory consumption is
computed from two pieces of information: The maximum number of each volume we
must keep during the process and the maximum size of each volume.

In the buffer extension algorithm, the buffer is stretched in one dimension at
a time (Figure~\ref{fig:bufferextensionalgo}).
When stretching the buffer, we compute the maximum length of the buffer possible
in the dimension considered, while ensuring that the remainder volumes can be
kept into memory according to the \texttt{keep} algorithm. For example, if
we consider stretching the buffer in the $j$ dimension, we want to know how big
$B_j$ can be such that the remainders are kept in memory by the \texttt{keep}
algorithm for later use, given the maximum amount of memory available, $m$.

\begin{figure*}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{./figures/new/bufferextensionalgo.png}
\caption{desc.}
\label{fig:bufferextensionalgo}
\end{figure*}

$\Sigma$, the maximum amount of data reached during the execution of the keep
algorithm is defined in terms of the number of volumes to keep in cache. From the
previous sections we assume that the buffer order is the storage order.
In this order, the $F_1$ volume stored from a given buffer loading is recycled
in the next one (Figure~\ref{fig:calculmemoire}). Therefore there can be only
one $F_1$ volume in cache at a
given time. $F_2$ and $F_3$ are kept in memory until the next
buffer in the $j$ dimension recyles them. Therefore they can be present in cache
$n$ times at a maximum, with $n$ the number of buffers in a buffer column (the
number of buffers in dimension $k$). Volumes 4 to 7 can only be recycled by the
next buffer in the $i$ dimension. Therefore, the algorithm must read an entire
buffer slice before being able to remove them from the cache. They are kept a
maximum of $N$ times, with $N$ the number of buffers in a slice of the
reconstructed image (Figure~\ref{fig:calculmemoire}).
Last but not least, a buffer must be loaded at each step of
the keep algorithm. This gives us the following formula for $\Sigma$:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:2}
\Sigma = F_1 + n(F_2 + F_3) + N(F_4 + F_5 + F_6 + F_7) + B_iB_jB_k
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{./figures/new/bufferextensionalgoformula.jpeg}
\caption{desc.}
\label{fig:calculmemoire}
\end{figure}

Now that we have an expression for $\Sigma$, we must find its maximum value by
computing the volumes' sizes and their maximum.

\subsection{The getBufferPositions function}

In order to compute $\Sigma$, the volumes' sizes need to be computed using the
following nomenclature (Figure~\ref{fig:nomenclature_overlaps}):
Given a buffer shape $B$ and the output file shape $O$, we define $C_d(x)$ as
the overlap length between the buffer and an overlaping output file in direction
$d$ for the $x^{th}$ buffer. Let us define $\Omega$ and $\Theta$, that are used
to define upper bounds in the volumes sizes formulas. $\Omega_d(x)$ is the
equivalent of $C_d(x)$ if the buffer was of shape $\Lambda$, and $\Theta_k(x)$
is the difference between $B_d$ and $\Omega_b$, with $B=\Lambda$.
These metrics are computed as follows:
$$C_d(x) = (x+1)B_d mod(O_d)$$
$$\Omega_d(x) = (x+1)\Lambda_d mod(O_d)$$
$$\Theta_d(x) = \Lambda_d - \Omega_d(x)$$

The volumes sizes are computed in Appendix~\ref{bufferExtensionAlgorithm}.
Finally, to find the maximum size
of each volume one must know the maximum overlap length between the buffer and
the output files on its border. One can either compute all possibilities and
take the maximum in each dimension if it is not too costly or use the following
upper bound: By definition of an input aggregate, the overlap between any buffer
and its bordering output files it at maximum $O_x$ in dimension $x$. Once the
maximum volumes' sizes are found they can be replaced in $\Sigma$ to find the
maximum memory consumption of the keep algorithm.

Given equation~\ref{eq:2} and the maximum size of the volumes, we can now
stretch the buffer shape one dimension at a time using simple equations to ensure
that the maximum amount of memory consumed during the process will stay below the
amount of memory available. Such computations are given in
Appendix~\ref{bufferExtensionAlgorithm}.
Algorithm~\ref{algo:bufferextensionalgorihm} summarizes the computations into a
pseudocode for the buffer extension algorithm which returns two pieces of
information: the best buffer shape affordable given $m$ and the indices of the
remainder volumes that can be kept in cache. The maximum value that the buffer
can take at any step of the algorithm is represented by $\phi$ (lines 6, 11,
16, 21).

Now that the best buffer shape can be computed, we can express the
\texttt{getBufferPositions} function (Algorithm~\ref{algo:generalrepartition}) in
Algorithm~\ref{algo:getbuffersposition}.

\section{Implementation}
%----------------------------------------

\subsection{Clustered strategy}

As explained in the introduction, \texttt{dask} represents computations by a task graph.
Implementing the clustered strategy consisted in modifying that graph. To that
aim, we implemented an optimization function to create ``buffer" tasks in the
graph (Figure~\ref{fig:bufferization}).

\begin{figure*}
  \centering

  \subfloat[\texttt{dask} graph for splitting a multidimensional array.]{{\includegraphics[width=8cm]{./figures/new/before_store.png} }}
  \qquad
  \subfloat[Same \texttt{dask} graph after creating a buffer task (\texttt{merged part}).]{{\includegraphics[width=8cm]{./figures/new/after_store.png} }}

  \caption{Optimization of a \texttt{dask} graph of a split using the clustered strategy.}
  \label{fig:bufferization}

\end{figure*}

The optimization starts by converting the task graph into a mathematical
directed graph for use by a BFS (Breadth First Search) algorithm. More
precisely, we implemented it as adjacency lists. The BFS algorithm allows us to
find and store tasks by type for later processing.  Again, the clustered
strategy loads buffers block by block, block columns by block columns or block
slices by block slices~\cite{seqalgorithms}. Assuming that the whole array is
being processed, we find the appropriate buffering scheme from $I$, $O$ and $m$.

We then updated the data loading tasks to force \texttt{dask} to load a whole buffer at
a time instead of small chunks. Finally, we modified the dependent tasks to make
them use our new buffer tasks. According to the clustered algorithm, all buffers
do not necessarily have the same shape, that is why we could not use the
\texttt{dask.array.rechunk} method.

The default scheduler for \texttt{dask.array} is the multi-threaded scheduler. It means
that at the beginning of the execution \texttt{dask} dispatches some tasks that have
no dependencies into different threads. The problem is that the clustered
strategy tries to use all the memory available for each buffer, and such buffer
tasks are the one with no initial dependencies. Therefore, we needed to
modify \texttt{dask}'s scheduler to make it load one buffer only at a time.
This avoids running out of memory during the processing.

\subsection{The keep algorithm}

The buffer extension algorithm described before has been directly
implemented in plain Python. Implementing the last part of the algorithm
consisted in: (1) creating the buffer tasks, (2) dispatching the different data
parts loaded by each buffer into the appropriate output files, (3) simulating
the cache to keep remainders in memory between buffer loadings.

This time, the buffer task creation was straightforward as it is assumed by the
algorithm that the buffers constitute a partition of the whole array. For the
second and third part, we used the \texttt{dask.array.store} method that
requires input arrays as argument, together with the output files in which to
store the data and the indices of each data part in the output files. To
automatically compute such information, we proceeded as follows. We first
compute, for each output file, the list of each constitutive subarrays, with
subarrays defined by the intersection of input and output files and buffers.
When each output file ``knows" which part from which buffer are required, we
merge some of them according to the keep strategy to enforce the fact that
a given data part of a given output file has to be stored at once. By doing this
we create dependencies in the task graph. Such dependency tells \texttt{dask} that it
needs to load two buffers before writing a given subarray for example.

\subsection{Dask repartition}

Both implementations are available in a same Python package called \texttt{dask repartition}. It
contains tests with 99\% coverage and is available on PyPI (The Python Package
Index). \texttt{dask repartition} provides a simple API to use the split, merge and repartition
algorithms described in this study (Figure~\ref{fig:daskrepartition_split}).

\begin{figure}
  \begin{verbatim}
  from dask_io.optimizer as opt
  from opt.cases.case_config import Split

  case = Split(inputfilepath, I)
  case.split_hdf5_multiple(datadir)
  arr = case.get()

  enable_clustering(ONE_GIG * 5)
  arr.compute()
  \end{verbatim}

\section{Experiments}
%----------------------------------------
This section describes the three experiments we did in this study. All the
results are described in the ``Results" section, and the code of the experiments
is available in a dedicated repository on Github.

\subsection{Dask's sensitivity to seeks}
We first designed
an experiment to prove that \texttt{dask.array} was subject to the seek problem.
To that aim we created a random array from a uniform distribution and stored it
as a HDF5 file for later processing. The array had a shape of
$(1925, 1512, 1750)$ which represents 1/8
of the Big Brain size. The experiment then consisted in splitting and merging
the array with \texttt{dask} using two different chunk shapes: one of them,
$(275,189,250)$, doing more seeks than the other; $(5,1512,1750)$
(Table~\ref{tab:exp1}). We did this experiment on both HDD and SSD to see if the
results were also visible when using an SSD which is suposedly less affected by
seeks. The results of this experiment showed that \texttt{dask} was indeed
subject to the seek problem.

\begin{table}[ht]
 \centering
 \caption{Experiment 1}

  \begin{tabular}[t]{c c c c}
  \hline
  chunks shape & R partition & nb of chunks & nb voxels/chunk \\
    \hline\hline
    (5,1512,1750) & (385,1,1) & 385 & 13,230,000 \\
    \hline
    (275,189,250) & (7,8,7) & 392 & 12,993,750 \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}

  \label{tab:exp1}
\end{table}

\subsection{Evaluation of the clustered strategy with dask}
In order to see if we could reduce the split/merge processing time of dask, we
implemented and tested the ``clustered" strategy for splitting and merging
multidimensional arrays. We chose this strategy first because it seemed simpler
to implement. We also know from~\cite{seqalgorithms} that the difference between
the naive and clustered strategies should be large enough to be visible in the
processing time. The shapes used for the experiment are shown on the
Table~\ref{tab:exp2}.

\begin{table}[ht]

  \begin{tabular}[t]{c c c c}
  \hline
    R & chunks shape & buffer size \\
    \hline\hline
    (3500, 3500, 3500) & (875, 875, 875) & 15 GB  \\
    \hline
    (3500, 3500, 3500) & (500, 500, 500) & 15 GB  \\
    \hline
    (3500, 3500, 3500) & (350, 350, 350) & 15 GB  \\
    \hline
    (3500, 3500, 3500) & (50, 3500, 3500) & 15 GB \\
    \hline
    (3500, 3500, 3500) & (28, 3500, 3500) & 15 GB \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}

  \label{tab:exp2}
\end{table}

\subsection{Evaluation of the keep algorithm}
After these two preliminary experiment, and in order to evaluate the
efficiency of the keep algorithm, we compared it against vanilla \texttt{dask}
on local computer. To be fair we used dask with one thread as required for our
implementation but also with the standard multi-threaded scheduler as it is the
default when using \texttt{dask.array}. In order to compare our implementation
and dask vanilla to a naive repartition, we also added a plain Python implementation
to the benchmark. For the experiments presented below we built a random 3D array
 of the size of Big Brain, drawn from a uniform distribution. Once again, the
 array is initially stored into an HDF5 file.

We did three sub-experiments on the keep algorithm on a multidimensional array
of shape $(3900,3000,3500)$. The first one consisted in comparing the different
implementations in the case where the keep algorithm is supposed to be the most
effective i.e. when the buffer is equal to the input aggregate $B_x=\Lambda_x$
(Table~\ref{tab:exp3_1}). This experiment aimed at showing if the keep
algorithm worked and seeing how much it can improve the processing speed.
The experiment has been done with $I>O$ and $I<O$ at different resolution:
$I~=\frac{R}{5}$, $I~=\frac{R}{10}$, $I~=\frac{R}{22}$ and $I$ of size the size
recommended by \texttt{dask} i.e. more than 100MB (about 200MB in our case).
Note that in Table~\ref{tab:exp3_1} we only tested $I<O$ when $I=(195,150,175)$
as the resulting $O$ size would be too small (less than 10MB).

\begin{table}[ht]
 \centering
 \caption{Experiment 3.1}

  \begin{tabular}[t]{c c c c}
  \hline
    I & O & $I<O$ & B is partition of R \\
    \hline\hline
    (780,600,700) & (650,500,500) & False & True \\
    \hline
    (780,600,700) & (975,1000,875) & True & False \\
    \hline
    (390,300,350) & (325,250,250) & False & True \\
    \hline
    (390,300,350) & (650,500,700) & True & True \\
    \hline
    (195,150,175) & (300,250,250) & True & True \\
    \hline
    (195,150,175) & (650,375,500) & True & False \\
    \hline
    (650,375,500) & (390,300,350) & False & True \\
    \hline
    (650,375,500) & (975,600,700) & True & False \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}

  \label{tab:exp3_1}
\end{table}

In the second experiment, we tested the case where $m$ is not big enough to get
$B=\Lambda$. We did this experiment at two different resolutions, with $I>O$
and $I<O$ (see Table~\ref{tab:exp3_2}) and tested two buffers for each case:
$B_1=(1,0.5\Lambda_j,\Lambda_k)$ and $B_2=(0.5\Lambda_i,\Lambda_j,\Lambda_k)$.
In each case, $B$, $I$ and $O$ must be a partition of $R$. There is one missing
experiment in Table~\ref{tab:exp3_2} as the resulting buffer $B_2$ was not a
partition of $R$.

\begin{table*}[ht]
 \centering
 \caption{Experiment 3.2}

  \begin{tabular}[t]{c c c c c}
  \hline
    $I$ & $O$ & $\Lambda$ & B1 & B2 \\
    \hline\hline
    (780,600,700) & (975,1000,875) ($I<O$) & (1560,1200,1400) & (1,600,1400) & Not a partition of R \\
    \hline
    (780,600,700) & (650,500,500) ($I>O$) & (780,600,700) & (1,300,700) & (390,600,700) \\
    \hline
    (390,300,350) & (650,500,700) ($I<O$) & (780,600,700) & (1,300,700) & (390,600,700) \\
    \hline
    (390,300,350) & (325,250,250) ($I>O$) & (390,300,350) & (1,150,350) & (195,300,350) \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \label{tab:exp3_2}
\end{table*}

Finally, the particular case of an important shape mismatch was tested, where
$O>>I$ and $O<<I$. In both cases the input aggegate will be quite big which is
supposed to be a bad case for the keep algorithm as extending the buffer to
$\Lambda$ will be more complicated. We tested several cases described in
Table~\ref{tab:exp3_3}. As one can see, $O>>I$ and $O<<I$ seems to be pretty
equivalent as in both cases the input aggregate shape is the same. But both are
worth experimenting as when $O<<I$ we only read one file, whereas $O>>I$ implies
that the algorithm has to switch between a lot of input files.

\section{Discussion}
%----------------------------------------

\subsection{The buffer ordering problem}
The buffer ordering problem can be modeled as follows: We can represent the
problem as a complete bidirectional graph in which each vertex is a buffer. At
initialization, we must choose a first buffer as an entry point. Let us define
a path in the graph as a visitation order of all buffers in the graph. One buffer
cannot appear twice in the list. Finally, let us define a cache that contains
the data currently in main memory. We define the buffer ordering problem as the
problem of finding the optimal path such that the amount of memory used by the
cache is kept minimal during the process. For each buffer, we load some data
into the cache (reading the buffer) and free some of it (writing into output files). The amount of
data released is different depending of the buffers previously visited and each
buffer can only be visited once which can be represented by removing all edges
pointing to a visited vertex except the one coming from the previously visited
vertex. One may solve this problem by using a greedy algorithm or a shortest path
algorithm but it would
incur more infering at runtime and a potentially complex algorithm to run.
We decided to keep things simple using a naive buffer order, the storage order,
as the goal of this study was primarily to assess if the keep algorithm works.

\subsection{Breaking the buffers}
To even reduce the maximum amount of memory used during the repartition process, we
could read the input files one by one instead of enforcing \texttt{dask} to read a whole
buffer at a time, provided that the input files' parts are read in the right
order (following the buffer order). The idea of reading an entire buffer at a
time came from the clustered and multiple strategies but we realized afterwards
that this could be beneficial to break the buffers into input files' parts. We
can see in Equation (2) that it would result in replacing $B_iB_jB_k$ by
$I_iI_jI_k$ or less if part of a file is loaded. This idea would only be
beneficial in the case where $B_x>I_x$. Indeed, in the other case, the buffer is
loaded anyways.

\subsection{ROI extraction problem}
The Region Of Interest (ROI) extraction problem is a related problem that still needs
to be adressed. A solution using chunking as been introduced in~\cite{optimal_chuking}. The authors
define an array partitioned into chunks of equal shapes and then define a
query as an arbitrary subarray of the input, chunked, array. They define the
optimal chunking problem as finding the optimal chunk such that the expected
number of chunks retrieved to answer the query is minimal. In our opinion, the
solution in~\cite{optimal_chuking} is limited due to the need of historical or theoretical workload
and the necessity to repartition the input array into an ``optimal" chunk shape. We
would prefer letting the application choose the appropriate chunk shape
regarding its needs and not needing to estimate the processing workload. We
define the ROI extraction problem as follows: Finding an algorithm that takes
as input an arbitrary chunk shape and extract the ROI data from the chunks with
the less number of seeks as possible.

\subsection{Solving three problems at once}
As stated in the introduction, the split and merge tasks are special cases of
the repartition task. This observation leads us to think that maybe one could find
one optimal algorithm for the split, merge and repartition tasks.

If we were to use the keep algorithm with $I=R$, we would read the input data
in slices, exactly like the multiple strategy. The only difference between the
two strategies, however, is that if some remainders appear at the bottom of the
buffer, the keep algorithm would keep it to try to read and write files in one
seek. Not only the keep algorithm tries to limit seeking into the files but it
also tries to limit switching between the files. It would be interesting to
compare the two algorithms for the split/merge tasks to see if the keep
implementation brings any kind of improvement.

\subsection{Towards distributed systems}
A future work would be to find distributed versions of the split/merge/repartition
algorithms. Lots of scientists use HPC (High Performance Computing) clusters
regularly which brings considerations about how to use such distributed
algorithms with Lustre for example, a commonly used filesystem for HPC. \texttt{dask}
also provides a distributed scheduler that seems to be quite efficient. It is
now recommended for use, even on local computers (using one node).

\section{Memory analysis for the buffer extension algorithm}
\label{bufferExtensionAlgorithm}

Using the nomenclature in section ``The buffer extension algorithm"
(see Figure~\ref{fig:nomenclature_overlaps}), the $x^{th}$ buffer, the volumes'
sizes are:

$\begin{cases}
F_1 = \Omega_k min(B_j, \Theta_j) min(B_i, \Theta_i) \\
F_2 = \Theta_k max(0, min(B_j - \Theta_j, \Omega_j)) min(B_i, \Theta_i) \\
F_3 = \Omega_k max(0, min(B_j - \Theta_j, \Omega_j)) min(B_i, \Theta_i) \\
F_4 = \Theta_k \Theta_j max(0, min(B_i-\Theta_i, \Omega_i)) \\
F_5 = \Omega_k \Theta_j max(0, min(B_i-\Theta_i, \Omega_i)) \\
F_6 = \Theta_k \Omega_j max(0, min(B_i-\Theta_i, \Omega_i)) \\
F_7 = \Omega_k \Omega_j max(0, min(B_i-\Theta_i, \Omega_i))
\end{cases}$

We are only interested in the maximum amount of memory that will be reached by
the algorithm. To that aim, we will not evaluate the above formula for each $x$
but we will replace each $\Omega_d(x)$ by its maximum in $\Sigma$.

In the following paragraphs, we are finding formulas to extend the buffer one
dimension at a time, for use in the buffer stretching algorithm.

\subsection{Formulas of the buffer extension}
\subsubsection{Keeping F1}

We first extend the buffer in the $j$ dimension to keep $F_1$.

\noindent $$F_1 = \Omega_k B_j B_i = \Omega_k B_j$$
$$\Sigma = F_1 + B_iB_jB_k$$
$$\Sigma = B_j (\Omega_k + \Lambda_k)$$
$$\Sigma \leq m \Leftrightarrow B_j (\Omega_k + \Lambda_k) \leq m$$
$$\Sigma \leq m \Leftrightarrow B_j \leq \frac{m}{\Omega_k + \Lambda_k}$$

We define $\phi$, the maximum value for $B_j$:
$$\phi = \lfloor \frac{m}{\Omega_k + \Lambda_k} \rfloor$$

When extending the buffer in the $j$ dimension, $B_i$ stays at 1, so by
definition of $F_1$ the maximum value that $F_1$ can take is $\Omega_k\Theta_j$.
$$B_j = \begin{cases}
  \Theta_j & \textrm{if }\phi \geq \Theta_j \\
  1 & \textrm{if }\phi = 0 \\
  \phi & \textrm{else}
\end{cases}$$

If $B_j=\Theta_j$, then we can continue stretching $B$ in the $j$ direction to
try to keep $F_2$ and $F_3$ areas.

\subsubsection{Keeping F2 and F3}

Let us define $\delta_j$, the amount we will try to add to $B_j$, such that:
$$B_j - \Theta_j = \delta_j$$
$$B_j = \delta_j + \Theta_j$$

From the previous subsection, $F_1$ is of size:
$$F_1 = \Omega_k \Theta_j B_i = \Omega_k \Theta_j$$
$F_2$ and $F_3$ are defined in terms of $\delta_i$:
$$F_2 = \Theta_k \delta_j B_i = \Theta_k \delta_j$$
$$F_3 = \Omega_k \delta_j B_i = \Omega_k \delta_j$$

We get:
$$\Sigma = F_1 + n(F_2+F_3)$$
$$\Sigma = \delta_j\Lambda_k(n+1) + \Theta_j(\Omega_k\Lambda_k)$$
$$\Sigma \leq m \leftrightarrow \frac{m-\Theta_j(\Omega_k\Lambda_k)}{\Lambda_k(n+1)}$$
$$\phi = \lfloor \frac{m-\Theta_j(\Omega_k\Lambda_k)}{\Lambda_k(n+1)} \rfloor$$
$$B_j = \begin{cases}
  \Lambda_j & \textrm{if }\phi \geq \Lambda_j \\
  B_j = \Theta_j & \textrm{if }(B_j+\phi) = 0 \\
  B_j + \phi & \textrm{else}
\end{cases}$$

Again, if $B_j=\Lambda_j$, we continue to stretch the buffer, this time in the
$i$ dimension as $B$ equals $\Lambda$ in the $k$ and $j$ direction.

\subsubsection{Increasing F1, F2 and F3 in the ith dimension}
$$F_1 = \Omega_k\Theta_jB_i$$
$$F_2 = \Theta_k\Omega_jB_i$$
$$F_3 = \Omega_k\Omega_jB_i$$
$$\Sigma = B_i(\Omega_k\Theta_j + n\Omega_j\Lambda_k + \Lambda_j\Lambda_k)$$
$$\Sigma \leq m \leftrightarrow B_i \leq \frac{m}{\Omega_k\Theta_j + n\Omega_j\Lambda_k + \Lambda_j\Lambda_k}$$
$$\phi = \lfloor \frac{m}{\Omega_k\Theta_j + n\Omega_j\Lambda_k + \Lambda_j\Lambda_k} \rfloor$$

$$B_i = \begin{cases}
  \Theta_i & \textrm{if }\phi \geq \Theta_i \\
  1 & \textrm{if }\phi = 0 \\
  \phi & \textrm{else}
\end{cases}$$

If $B_i=\Theta_i$, we continue to stretch the buffer.

\subsubsection{Keeping F4, F5, F6, F7}

$$\begin{cases}
  F_1 = \Omega_k\Theta_j\Theta_i \\
  F_2 = \Theta_k\Omega_j\Theta_i \\
  F_3 = \Omega_k\Omega_j\Theta_i \\
  F_4 = \Theta_k\Theta_j\delta_i \\
  F_5 = \Omega_k\Theta_j\delta_i \\
  F_6 = \Theta_k\Omega_j\delta_i \\
  F_7 = \Omega_k\Omega_j\delta_i \\
  B_i = \Theta_i + \delta_i \\
  B_j = \Lambda_j\\
  B_k = \Lambda_k\\
\end{cases}$$

$$\Sigma = F_1 + n(F_2 + F_3) + N(F_4 + F_5 + F_6 + F_7) + B_iB_jB_k$$
$$\Sigma = F_1 + n(F_2 + F_3) + N(F_4 + F_5 + F_6 + F_7) + (\Theta_i + \delta_i)\Lambda_j\Lambda_k$$
$$\Sigma = \Theta_i(\Omega_k\Theta_j + n\Omega_j\Lambda_k + \Lambda_j\Lambda_k) + (N+1)\delta_i\Lambda_j\Lambda_k$$

$$\Sigma \leq m \leftrightarrow \delta_i \leq \frac{m-\Theta_i(\Omega_k\Theta_j + n\Omega_j\Lambda_k + \Lambda_j\Lambda_k)}{(N+1)\Lambda_j\Lambda_k}$$
$$\phi = \lfloor \frac{m-\Theta_i(\Omega_k\Theta_j + n\Omega_j\Lambda_k + \Lambda_j\Lambda_k)}{(N+1)\Lambda_j\Lambda_k} \rfloor$$

$$B_i = \begin{cases}
  \Lambda_i & \textrm{if }(B_i+\phi) \geq \Lambda_i \\
  B_i = \Theta_i & \textrm{if }\phi = 0 \\
  B_i+\phi & \textrm{else}
\end{cases}$$

The algorithm stops here, as if $B_i=\Lambda_i$, then the buffer has been
successfully stretched to the input aggregate shape, $\Lambda$.
