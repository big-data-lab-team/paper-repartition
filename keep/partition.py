    A uniform partition of the array to be repartitioned. May be the array
    itself (partition of size 1), the input, output, read or write blocks.

    Attributes:
        shape: the shape of the blocks in the partition
        name: the name of the partition, from which block
              file names are generated
        array: a partition with 1 block, representing the partitioned array
              (might be None)
        blocks: a dictionary representing the blocks in the partition.
                Key is the block origin, value is the Block object.
        fill: 'zeros' to fill the block buffers with zeros, 'random' to fill
              them with random data, None to not fill them at all.
              Warning: this allocates memory.
        create_blocks: if set to False, don't create the blocks in the
              partition.
